      The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global
      pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus was first
      identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared
      a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19 on
      30 January 2020, and later declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 12
      June 2021, more than 175 million cases have been confirmed, with more than
      3.78 million confirmed deaths attributed to COVID-19, making it one of the deadliest
      pandemics in history.

    Watch for Symptoms People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported
    – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days
    after exposure to the virus. Anyone can have mild to severe symptoms. People
    with these symptoms may have COVID-19: Fever or chills Cough Shortness of breath
    or difficulty breathing Fatigue Muscle or body aches Headache New loss of taste
    or smell Sore throat Congestion or runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea This
    list does not include all possible symptoms. CDC will continue to update this
    list as we learn more about COVID-19. Older adults and people who have severe
    underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to
    be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.
    How can computer science contribute to stop the COVID-19 pandemic? The question
    of how computers can contribute to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic is being
    posed to experts in artificial intelligence (AI) all over the world. AI tools
    can help in many different ways. They are being used to predict the spread
    of the coronavirus, map its genetic evolution as it transmits from human to
    human, speed up diagnosis, and in the development of potential treatments,
    while also helping policymakers cope with related issues, such as the impact
    on transport, food supplies and travel. But in all these cases, AI is only
    effective if it has sufficient examples to learn from. As COVID-19 has taken
    the world into unchartered territory, the "deep learning" systems, which computers
    use to acquire new capabilities, don’t necessarily have the data they need
    to produce useful outputs. ICT information technologies proved to be very helpful
    in improving big data collection processes and analytics in various fields
    of social sciences, medical, economic, etc. ICT, Internet and Industry 4.0
    information technologies helped to reduce the negative impact of the SARS-CoV-2
    coronavirus pandemic ( Covid-19) on societies, economy, health care institutions,
    etc. These technologies have made it possible to increase the scale of digitization
    and Internetisation of remote communication processes as well as social, economic
    and other processes. Thanks to the implementation of ICT, Internet and Industry
    4.0 information technologies to remote communication processes, economic processes
    and the improvement of analytical processes implemented in various scientific
    disciplines, many institutions and economic entities have managed to significantly
    reduce the negative effects of the Coronavirus pandemic. Thanks to the aforementioned
    technologies, the scale of the health, economic, social, etc. crisis caused
    by the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic is much smaller than it would
    be if these technologies did not exist. Therefore, the current fourth technological
    revolution has proved to be very helpful in reducing the negative impact of
    the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus pandemic on the functioning of people,
    the operation of public institutions, economic entities and entire economies.
    If this type of pandemic appeared, for example, in the middle of the 20th century,
    i.e. before the development of computer science and the third technological
    revolution, then the negative impact of the SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) coronavirus
    pandemic on people and entire economies would be several times higher than
    that recorded in 2020. Companies from across the engineering spectrum have
    offered their assistance, and work is under way to build 30,000 devices. But
    what else can engineers do to help during this national and global crisis?
    For some expert suggestions, we asked a group of Professional Engineering readers:
    “Apart from making ventilators, how could engineers help the fight against
    coronavirus?” The answers are hugely encouraging, with many good ideas and
    willing helpers. They will hopefully provide inspiration for potential volunteers
    and maybe even guidance for under-pressure officials, who could use this engineering
    expertise to help minimise the worst of the virus’ impact. Of course, everyone
    should follow social distancing and other temporary rules. But with potentially
    months of restrictions ahead and the possibility of the outbreak stretching
    on, here are six ways that engineers could help. Prevent the spread With numbers
    of patients skyrocketing, stopping the spread of Covid-19 is an immediate concern.
    Multiple readers urged engineering companies to design, develop and manufacture
    more diagnostic kits, as well as improving logistics to distribute them quicker.
    Following criticism of the government’s comparatively low level of testing,
    one member suggested engineers could install “intelligent body temperature
    detectors at schools, supermarkets, etc”. Other cutting-edge engineering could
    help lower infection rates. “Cleaning solutions and material development with
    inbuilt anti-bacterial properties being developed into our design solutions
    would be positive,” said Daniel Marsh. Support the NHS More hospital spaces
    are needed for patients as the NHS comes under increasing strain. The ExCel
    Centre in East London is being co-opted as a field hospital and could reportedly
    hold up to 4,000 patients. Following similar measures in China, readers suggested
    engineers could help build new hospitals, including by designing and manufacturing
    buildings using offsite construction. Improving Personal Protective Equipment
    (PPE) for NHS staff was a common suggestion. “NHS masks are ‘one size fits
    all’,” said William Richardson. “To state the obvious, everyone's face is slightly
    different.” “Some of it looks quite rudimentary, and some needs very careful
    fitting to work properly,” said Simon Steven. Member Caroline Rose suggested
    improvements could include atmosphere control and filtering, and decontamination.
    UV decontamination units could reduce waste – and therefore demand – on essential
    equipment, said one reader.   With multiple efforts ongoing to develop a vaccine,
    Paul Russenberger said companies should prepare for increased demand for injection
    needles. Spread Stem knowledge While pupils might have hoped for a break during
    school closures, teaching is ongoing. This could be a great opportunity to
    educate and inspire a future generation of engineers, said Dave Hughes. “Help
    support education in Stem subjects to take the pressure from teachers, and
    provide some real-world examples to further engage our student population –
    of all ages – in what engineering can offer, and hopefully do something that
    is fun and real while they are learning in a virtual world,” he said. ‘Strengthen
    home industry’ Other members hoped the crisis will be a wake-up call about
    over-reliance on foreign imports. “Long term, the UK needs to think about what
    is manufactured here. Importing all your critical supplies only works if there
    isn't a crisis,” said Richard Goodfellow. “My hope is that we can strengthen
    home industry, leaving us less reliant on foreign imports when we have so many
    untapped skills and resources in the UK,” said Paul W. Prevent future outbreaks
    While the UK and countries around the world struggle with the current outbreak,
    several readers urged the industry to look ahead and plan for similar – or
    even worse – situations. “We need to use our ingenuity to prevent the problem
    becoming worse, and avoiding or being prepared for future outbreaks,” said
    Richard Hulmes.   Engineers should carry out a full assessment of medical equipment
    that might be required in similar situations, said Rich Pearson, to ensure
    that designs can be open-sourced and shared with manufacturers when needed.
    Industry itself should have a frank appraisal of its international activity
    to help prevent a repeat of this pandemic, said Paul Thurgood. Companies and
    employees might need to act differently in future. “Hopefully this will be
    a wake-up call in many ways. This is an aggressive virus, but it could be that
    in future another one will show itself much more slowly, infecting many more
    people and with much more serious effects. Many of us engage far too much in
    international travel, with little regard for global warming. The virus is here
    in the UK solely because of this travel.” Run the country   For Justin Greenhalgh,
    the best way engineers could help is simple: “By being put in charge of the
    country and making long-term decisions!” Others suggested practical ways of
    helping the government, including giving guidance on statistical modelling
    and risk assessment, managing supply chains and assisting planning. “Whole-system
    thinking is something that is often lacking in central government – partly
    because it can be really hard,” said Grant Tuff. “Engineers can help with this,
    in terms of understanding the implications of different options and choices
    for handling many aspects of the current situation.
